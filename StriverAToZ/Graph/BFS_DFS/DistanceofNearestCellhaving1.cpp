/*

Breadth First Search, BFS, is a traversal technique where we visit the nodes level-wise, i.e.,
 it visits the same level nodes simultaneously, and then moves to the next level. 

The intuition is that BFS will take a step from cells containing 1 and will reach out to all
zeros that are at a distance of one. Apparently, we can say that the nearest 1 to the 0s is
at a distance of one. Again if we take another step, we will reach the next set of zeros,
for these zeros 1 is at a distance of two. If we continue the same, till we can go, we can
 reach all the 0â€™s possible. 



- Push the pair of starting points and its steps (<coordinates, stept>) in the queue, 
and mark the cell as visited.
- Start the BFS traversal, pop out an element from the queue every time, and travel 
to all its unvisited neighbors having 0. 
- For every neighboring unvisited 0, we can mark the distance to be +1 of the current node distance and store it in the distance 2D array, 
and at the same time insert <{row, col}, steps+1> into the queue.
- Repeat the steps until the queue becomes empty and then return the distance matrix 
where we have stored the steps.
