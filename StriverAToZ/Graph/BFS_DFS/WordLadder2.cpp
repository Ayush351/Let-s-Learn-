/*

Firstly, we start by creating a hash set to store all the elements present 
in the wordList which would make the search and delete operations faster for us to implement.

Next, we create a Queue data structure for storing the successive sequences/path in the
form of a vector which on transformation would lead us to the target word.

Now, we add the startWord to the queue as a List and also push it into the 
usedOnLevel vector to denote that this word is currently being used for 
transformation in this particular level.

Pop the first element out of the queue and carry out the BFS traversal, where for 
each word that popped out from the back of the sequence present at the top of the queue, 
we check for all of its characters by replacing them with ‘a’ - ‘z’ if they are 
present in the wordList or not. In case a word is present in the wordList, we simply 
first push it onto the usedOnLevel vector and do not delete it from the wordList immediately.

Now, push that word into the vector containing the previous sequence and add it to the queue.
So we will get a new path, but we need to explore other paths as well, so pop the
word out of the list to explore other paths.

After completion of traversal on a particular level, we can now delete all the words
that were currently being used on that level from the usedOnLevel vector which ensures
that these words won’t be used again in the future

f at any point in time we find out that the last word in the sequence present at the top 
of the queue is equal to the target word, we simply push the sequence into the resultant 
vector if the resultant vector ‘ans’ is empty.
