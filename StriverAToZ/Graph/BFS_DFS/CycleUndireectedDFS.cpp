/*

The cycle in a graph starts from a node and ends at the same node. DFS is a traversal 
technique that involves the idea of recursion and backtracking. DFS goes in-depth, i.e., 
traverses all nodes by going ahead, and when there are no further nodes to traverse in the 
current path, then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes. 
The intuition is that we start from a source and go in-depth, and reach any node that has 
been previously visited in the past; it means there's a cycle.
