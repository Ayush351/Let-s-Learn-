/*
Problem Statement: A Ninja has an ‘N’ Day training schedule. He has to perform one
of these three activities (Running, Fighting Practice, or Learning New Moves) 
each day. There are merit points associated with performing an activity each day. 
The same activity can’t be performed on two consecutive days. We need to find the 
maximum merit points the ninja can attain in N Days.
